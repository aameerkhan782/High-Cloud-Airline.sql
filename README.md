Description - In this project, I validated and analyzed the business of High-Cloud Airlines with the help of KPI metrics and visual charts using different tools such as MS Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and MySQL.
Based on the Requirement of the client we have developed the visualization.


1. Transported Passenger by Carrier Name:
   - Analyzed the total number of passengers traveling with each airline.
   - Identified the top 10 carrier names based on passenger count.

2. Weekend vs Weekdays:
   - Analyzed the total number of passengers traveling on weekends and weekdays.
   - Helped the company understand the customer traveling pattern to plan flights and costings accordingly.

3. Departures Performed:
   - Analyzed the total number of flights traveling from different cities.
   - Identified the most demanding routes based on cities.

4. Load Factor by Year:
   - Analyzed the load factor for each year.
   - The load factor measures the percentage of available seating capacity filled with passengers.
   - A high load factor indicates a preferred airline with most seats sold.

5. Load Factor by Month:
   - Analyzed the load factor based on months.
   - Helped identify trends and demand patterns over the months.

Please share your insightful comments and recommendations for future development.
